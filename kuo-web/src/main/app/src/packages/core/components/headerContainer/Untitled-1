The real joy in life comes from finding your true purpose and aligning it with 
what you do every single day.

Money is a good servant but a bad master.

We'd work because we want to, not because we have to.

The secret to wealth is simple:
Find a way to do more for others than anyone else does.
Become more valuable. Do more. Give more. Be more. Serve more.
